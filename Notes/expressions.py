# YS 6th exprestion notes

#what is a algorithm?
    # An algorithm is a set of insurction to accoplish a task.
    #Sarah had 10 apples to give to 6 friends. How many apples does each person get? 10/6 = 1
    # An expresstion is a 

name=input("what is your name? ")
print("hello", name)

 # algorithm for area
length=5
width=20
area= length * width 
print(length, "*", width, "=", area )


#List steps in an algorithm
    # step 1:  what variables/pieces of information are needed.
    # step 2: procces information.
    # step 3:  Provide an output.


#average age of a group of 4
age_one= 14
age_two=14
age_three=15
age_four=15

total= age_one + age_two + age_three + age_four 
average=total /4 
print( "average age", age_one, "-", age_two, "-", age_three, "-", age_four, "/", 4, "=", average )

#List ALL of the different mathematical operators (Give me the symbol and tell me what it does)
     # math equations
num_one=12
num_two=4
print("addtion", num_one + num_two)
print("subrtaction", num_one - num_two)
print("multiply", num_one * num_two)
print("division", num_one / num_two)
print("exponets", num_one ** num_two)
print("integer divistion", num_one // num_two)
print("modulo (remander)", num_one % num_two)


#List ALL of the different assignment operators (Give me the symbols and what it does)
    # + is adding    # - is subtract   # * is multiply # / is divide
